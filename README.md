# Noctis Lux Medium

An extended version of the Noctis Lux theme for Visual Studio Code with custom colors, basically has some slightly darkened tones as I found the original was a bit too light.

## Features

- Custom background, gutter, minimap, and terminal colors
- Custom styles for unused variables
- Enhanced visibility for updated items in the file explorer

### Installing from the Marketplace

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Noctis Lux Medium".
4. Click "Install" to install the theme.

## Activating the Theme

1. After installing the extension, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type "Color Theme" and select "Preferences: Color Theme" from the dropdown menu.
3. Select "Noctis Lux Medium (DeanRTaylor's version)" from the list of available themes.
