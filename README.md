# Noctis Lux Medium

An extended version of the Noctis Lux theme for Visual Studio Code with custom colors, basically has some slightly darkened tones as I found the original was a bit too light.

## Features

- Custom background, gutter, minimap, and terminal colors
- Custom styles for unused variables
- Enhanced visibility for updated items in the file explorer
